                Jody Sutter started her career “dialing for dollars” in a sales
                position. The resiliency and sales skills she gained became a
                huge asset in the agency space. She spent nearly two decades
                leading business development at agencies like Havas and R/GA
                before starting her firm, The Sutter Company.
              </p>
              <p>
                She now supports small marketing agencies through coaching,
                workshops and hands-on programs. As an agency veteran, Jody
                quickly identifies the challenges young agencies face. Her
                outsider perspective gives agencies the insight to understand
                their strengths and how to position their brand to win more
                deals.

<h5>why is it free?</h5>
<span id="sub-header">
Because we're selling something,<br/> obviously. But this is no pitchfest.</span>
<p>In fact, there will only be one pitch, in one presentation, at the very end.</p>
<p>We’re excited about this world-class event, and we intend to make this the best time you'll spend working on your agency (rather than in it) this year.</p>
<p>And if you think we did a good job, we hope you'll do us the professional courtesy of coming to our pitch and listening to what we have to say.</p>
<p>We look forward to hanging out and getting to know you, and making a difference for your agency in 2022.</p>
<p><b>P.S. The recordings? Not free, but worth every penny if you can't show up live!</b></p>
